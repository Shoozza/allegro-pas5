============
Introduction
============

  Allegro.pas5 is a wrapper to allow Pascal compilers (such as Free Pascal or
  Delphi) to use the Allegro library.

  This is a WIP (alpha) version for the Allegro 5 version. It is released
  to show what's done and to allow developers to test it and give feedback.

  Current version was tested only on GNU/Linux, OS X and Windows with Free Pascal
  and also on Windows with Delphi 7.

  The goal is to make Allegro.pas5 compatible with any operating system
  supported by Allegro, which are Windows, Linux, OS X, iOS and Android.

  As this is a WIP alpha version, there is some missing functionality.

Implemented
-----------

  + Event manager, including but not limited to keyboard, mouse, timer and
    display.

  + OpenGL support (except extensions).

  + Software bitmaps.

  + Text drawing.

  + Transformations.

Partially implemented or need more testing
------------------------------------------

  * Primitive drawing.

  * Audio samples and streams.

  * Native dialogs.

  * ttf fonts.


Unimplemented
-------------

  - OpenGL extensions.

  - kcm audio.

  - Custom memory management.

  - Phys file system.

  - Demonstration game.

  You can read more about this at the "docs/internal" subdirectory.

  Allegro.pas5 is released under zlib/png license. See the LICENSE file for
  details. Authors are listed in the AUTHORS file.



============
Installation
============

  First you must install Allegro itself.  Current Allegro.pas5 version is
  compatible with version 5.2.x of Allegro. Visit Allegro's project website at
  http://alleg.sf.net/ to download it. The package includes installation
  instructions.

  Then you need a Pascal compiler.  At the moment only Free Pascal and Delphi
  were tested but may be other compilers (such as GNU/Pascal) can be used too.

  Each combination of compiler and operating system may need different
  configuration so if it doesn't compile open file "lib/allegro.cfg" and modify
  it.  REMEMBER what do you change and let me know it so I can add it in future
  releases.



=============
Documentation
=============

  At the moment the public documentation isn't complete.  Since symbols have
  same name than the C version you can use the original Allegro documentation.

  I've put some information at the docs/internal subdirectory.  Read it
  specially if you're planning to write or hack your own test programs.
